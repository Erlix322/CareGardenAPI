## Motivation

Since my professor for software engineering was recently talking about common software architectures, I decided to dive into the world of Node.js.
This little RESTful service is the result of the last week and I'd like to share this code with you guys!

## Aim of this Work

Within my "software engineering 2" course I have to work together with an amazing team to build a little application as a student project and we decided to follow the (3-tier) architecture.
Although, this kind of architecture is quite easy to understand and also to implement. It became clear that at some point it gets difficult. Especially when it comes to authentication processes, the 3-tier architecture is not the best way to go.
Therefore I decided to go forth to tier-4!

##Node.JS and NPM
TODO!!
